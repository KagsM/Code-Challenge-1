# Code-Challenge-1

A JavaScript code challenge that runs JavaScript files in the console and requires prompts to take in user input and give output. The JavaScript files are organized into separate folders.

---

## Description

This code challenge demonstrates how to capture and process user input from the console using Node.js. It uses the `prompt-sync` library to handle synchronous user prompts.

Each module in the project performs a unique task and is located in a separate folder:

- `bodaFareCalculator/fare.js`: [This code is a simple program to estimate the fare for a boda boda ride.]
- `chaiCalculator/chai.js`: [This code is a simple calculator to determine the basic ingredients needed to make a specific number of cups of Kenyan chai.]
- `mobileMoneyEstimaitor`: [This code is a simplified estimator for transaction fees.]
